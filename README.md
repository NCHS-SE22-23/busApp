### Purpose and Overview
The Naperville Central High School bus web applicationâ€™s purpose is to make it easier for students to get on their bus and for administrators to direct this process. Administrators are able to display bus statuses on the web app for students to see in real time while they are waiting for their bus after school. With this application we hope to abolish the use of the intercom to announce bus changes and whether the buses have arrived, substantially decrease the amount of work for administrators, and ensure that no student misses their bus.
